# express-server

I built a REST API with Node and Express, using Yarn as a package manager, while running the server inside a Docker container.

The functions in the ‘users’ service would normally talk to a database to create & fetch records within the ‘users’ table and merely serves as an example as to how a REST API could be used with various methods.
